      <p>
        I am a senior engineer with a background in <strong>experimental physics</strong>,
        <strong>software development</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure engineering</strong>,
        with experience spanning scientific research, data-intensive systems, and
        production infrastructure.
      </p>

      <p>
        My career began in <strong>high-energy physics</strong> (CERN / CMS), working on
        large-scale distributed systems and data analysis. Over time, I transitioned
        toward software and infrastructure engineering, where I have focused on
        deploying, operating, and supporting complex systems in real organizational
        contexts.

        This GitHub profile collects selected public work, experiments, and technical
        explorations across those domains.

      <h2>Scientific &amp; Research Work</h2>

      <h3>CMS Experiment – CERN (2008–2013)</h3>
      <p>
        During my time at CERN, I worked within the <strong>CMS experiment</strong>,
        contributing to software and analysis workflows supporting trigger systems
        and detector data processing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Data analysis and validation code</li>
        <li>Emulation and testing of trigger components (RPC Technical Trigger Unit or TTU)</li>
        <li>Experimental C++ and Python tools developed in a large, distributed collaboration</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This period shaped my approach to distributed systems under strict correctness
        constraints, reproducibility, and engineering in high-stakes environments.
      </p>

      <h3>High-Energy Neutrinos &amp; Astrophysics (Universidad de los Andes)</h3>
      <p>
        While studying high-energy neutrinos, I developed numerical models for
        neutrino oscillations in matter with varying density, extending prior work
        by <strong>Tommy Ohlsson</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>This work resulted in peer-reviewed publications:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Oscillation of high energy neutrinos in choked GRBs</em><br />
          Eur. Phys. J. C73 (2013) 2574<br />
          DOI: 10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2574-8
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>High energy neutrinos from choked GRBs and their flavor ratio measurement by IceCube</em><br />
          Eur. Phys. J. C75 (2015) 289<br />
          DOI: 10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3524-4
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This experience continues to inform how I think about modeling, validation,
        and system behavior under uncertainty.

      <h2>Infrastructure &amp; Applied Engineering</h2>

      <h3>Infrastructure &amp; Deployment Work (C1)</h3>
      <p>
        At <strong>C1</strong>, I worked on infrastructure, deployment efforts, the use and application of best
        practices with
        a focus on operationalizing complex software systems rather than pure feature development.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key project was the deployment of <strong>Open edX</strong> for a pilot education
        program, which involved:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Deploying and operating Open edX on Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Defining and provisioning supporting infrastructure components</li>
        <li>Working across application, infrastructure, and operational boundaries</li>
        <li>Supporting a real pilot with production-like constraints</li>
        <li>Monitoring and maintaining the deployed systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This work required practical experience with Kubernetes fundamentals,
        infrastructure setup and lifecycle management, best practices, and troubleshooting
        distributed systems in live environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        While recent, this experience represents hands-on infrastructure work in a
        real delivery context, not just experimentation.

      <h2>Data &amp; Applied Analytics</h2>

      <h3>Data Science for All – Colombia (DS4A 5.0)</h3>
      <p>
        Selected code from my participation in <strong>DS4A Colombia</strong>, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Data analysis and feature engineering</li>
        <li>Pre-programming challenges</li>
        <li>Collaborative team-based work</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some project code remains private due to confidentiality agreements, but this
        experience strengthened my interest in applied data work connected to
        real-world problems.

      <p>
        My engineering focus emphasizes correctness over cleverness, systems thinking
        across boundaries, and learning through building and operating real systems.
