{"name":"Andres Osorio","tagline":"My code repository","body":"## CMSWork\r\n\r\nThis repository contains most of the code that I have developed during my days at the [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/) experiment at CERN from 2008 to 2013. It contains all sort of source code for data analysis, emulation of the TTU, and many other experimental code.\r\n\r\n## GRBsWork\r\n\r\nWhile studying High Energy Neutrinos at The Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes) in closed collaboration with Profesor Sahu, I developed this code that models the oscillation of neutrinos through matter of varying density. We produced the following two publications using this code.\r\n\r\n* **Oscillation of high energy neutrinos in Choked GRBs**, Andres Felipe Osorio Oliveros, Sarira Sahu, Juan Carlos Sanabria, Eur.Phys.J. C73 (2013) 2574 DOI [10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2574-8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2574-8)\r\n* **High energy neutrinos from choked GRBs and their flavor ratio measurement by the IceCube**, Karla Varela, Sarira Sahu, Andrés Felipe Osorio Oliveros, Juan Carlos Sanabria, Eur.Phys.J. C75 (2015) 289 DOI [10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3524-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3524-4)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
